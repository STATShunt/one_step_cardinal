This is the code and data to reproduce the results, tables and charts in Sarkar et al. (2022).

The only requirements to reproduce the results are R (version 4.0 or later), with installed packages for tidyr and ggplot2 (needed for the charts).  

You need to download the INPUT data files and the INPUT code script (either download the two .csv files and .R file with INPUT as a prefix, or download and unpack the INPUT_all.zip folder).  Then you need to open a session in R and ensure that its working directory contains the data files.  Running the R script in that session will then produce output files that match the contents of Sarkar et al. (2022) (to within simulation error for the bootstrapping results).  In addition, the output on your machine should be analogous to the files in the OUTPUT_all.ZIP folder above.

You are welcome to take this code and apply it to your own data or extend it to your own models.  Please cite Sarkar et al. (2022) in any published research that follows from substantive use of the code or paper.

The complete set of files in the "scenario analysis" folder is the same except that there is a more flexible loss function (see the final section of the Appendix in the paper that introduces the scenario analysis). 

Please contact Dipon Sarkar (dipon.sarkar "at" utas.edu.au) or Ian Hunt (ihunt "at" bunhill.co.uk) for any assistance with the code.
